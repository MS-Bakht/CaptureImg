## Description:
The Camera Application with Image Capture is a Python project that utilizes OpenCV (cv2) and Tkinter libraries to create a user-friendly camera application with an image capture feature. This application allows users to stream their camera feed, capture images with a single click, and save them to a specified folder on their computer.

## Features:

Camera Feed: The application utilizes OpenCV to access the camera feed and display it in real-time within a Tkinter window. Users can see themselves or their surroundings through the camera.

Image Capture: With the click of a button labeled "Capture," users can capture the current frame displayed in the camera feed. The captured image is then saved to a specified folder on the computer.

Folder Selection: Users have the flexibility to choose the location where the captured images will be saved. The folder location can be easily specified within the application.
